This is a C-based space navigation simulator that models interplanetary travel in our solar system.

  Project Overview

  - Executable: space_navigator (already compiled)
  - Language: C
  - Build System: Shell script using clang compiler
  - Status: Fully compiled with object files (.o) present

  Project Structure

  Core Modules:

  1. planet.c/h - Planetary mechanics
    - Defines Planet struct (name, orbit radius, orbital period)
    - Defines Vector3D for 3D coordinates
    - Calculates planet positions over time
    - Distance calculations
  2. destinations.c/h - Destination database
    - Maintains array of known destinations (planets)
    - Lookup functionality by name
    - Display all available destinations
  3. navigation.c/h - Navigation system
    - ShipState tracking (position, time, current destination)
    - Hohmann transfer orbit calculations
    - Phasing time computations
    - Travel system execution
    - Information display and formulae
  4. main.c - Main program loop
    - Interactive console menu system
    - Ship named "Mineral-Raider-1"
    - Starts at Earth
    - Menu options: Info, Destinations, Formulae, Hohmann Transfer, Travel System
  5. travel01.c - Additional travel module (not linked in current build)
  6. stories.txt - Narrative content describing entering the Sun

  Features
